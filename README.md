# About
Data-driven, Full-stack Marketing Strategist 

Having a passion for developing digital content strategy that is logical, consistent, measurable and effective. This includes team leadership, project management, technical acumen, consistent messaging and superior storytelling with the goal of exceeding KPI’s and boosting performance. How? Through data-driven planning, enthusiasm, skill and a little intuition.
 
Targeted strategy and a strong information architecture lay the foundation. Next the content – whether micro-interactions, landing pages or long form, written with a purpose and designed for each stage of the buying cycle. Next? Traffic acquisition. Organic, paid, social, referral - what matters is matching the message with the channel and the channel with the content, whether in the B2B, B2C, social engagement or micro-interaction space. Planning and optimizing these strategies is where I come in.
