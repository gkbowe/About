Thank you for visiting. Please keep in mind that my public repo's are not updated often - I am blessed to have a wonderful family and work full-time and have little time to make updates here.

## Professional Summary

Here's a little about professional life: I create and implement strategies for digital content and I help organizations define priorities, refine processes, and establish new systems in order to deliver content to the right users in the right format and at the right time. By focusing on the userâ€™s experience - and effectively communicating goals and expectations, I've guided teams in the development and implementation of training materials, governance models, business strategies, and optimization approaches.

I have both technical experience ranging from administering servers to front-end web development. Whether working using Agile, AINO (Agile in name only) or other methods, I've learned that clear communication, setting reasonable expectations, and understanding the personalities of the team-members are key components to any project's success.
